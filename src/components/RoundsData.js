Try tools like exiftool, steghide, and unzip to uncover secrets. Tip: If you encounter multiple .zip files, think of automation! A simple Bash script can help iterate through nested archives. Password-protected? The filename itself might be the key! 🗝️ Hint: 🔥 Evolution takes patience—keep extracting layer by layer! 🚀",
